# Responsible Investor

## Hello and welcome to our group project: Responsible Investor

For this project, we want to show the negative impacts of oil companies on our climate and give an alternative to our clients to invest in a green portfolio.

We are using the Yahoo ESG scores that are pulled from Sustainalytics. We are focusing on the Environmental scores specifically which can range between 0 and 100. A company with a score between 0-10 would have good controls over their environmental footprint and initiatives. Some of the facots that are assessed for the Environmental score are: Greenhouse Gas Emission, Water Use, Energy Use, Environmental policies.

We will first demonstrate the temperature change over the past years along with the global CO2 emission and how these two factors are correlated with the growth of some oil companies.

In a second part, we will introduce some green investing options. We have selected specific industries: Solar, Renewable Energy for Utilities, Auto Manufactures, Electrical Equipments and Speciality Chemicals. These industries englobe companies that have a good environmental score (less than 10).
We used Yahoo Finance to pull an intial list of companies. We also focused on companies with a current ratio higher than 1.5 and a Price/Earning less than 50.

Once we determined the green companies we want to analyze. We pulled historical data using the Alpaca API and we conducted our financial analysis: Daily Return, Standard Deviation to assess volatility, low level of correlation between selected companies etc..

We will use the S&P 500 index as a benchmark throughout the analysis.
Stocks that we picked are:
